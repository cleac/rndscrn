# Random screenshot

## About project

Some days ago, QA's from my team found interesting thing at prnt.sc website.
All the screenshots at this service are available for anyone. So I made a
little script that generates a random link to prnt.sc service and opens it.

## How to use it?

Simply call [open.sh](open.sh) at your terminal. This won't work on Windows but
should work on \*nix like OS.
